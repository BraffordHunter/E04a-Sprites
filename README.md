This is about sprites. Sprites are the interactive pieces of the game. The one that move, interact, and can actually do something in the game itself. An examples of this are the enemies in a Mario game, that can move, attack, and interact with Mario, Luigi, and every interactive object available. This is showing the basics of how to code sprites to appear, and give them the ability to interact within their surroundings. As well as how to duplicate them continuously to get as many to appear at once.
